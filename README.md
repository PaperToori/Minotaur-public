# Minotaur-public
Examensarbete

I wanted to try and make a game with Duke Nukem-visuals with some element of ranmdomness/rogue-like to it.
I had previous practice generating mazes, and decided to put those two ideas together!

### Controls
A & D        - strafe
UP & DOWN    - Move
LEFT & RIGHT - Rotate

### Messing around
Several definitions in define.cpp will crash the game if touched, but some can be fiddled with freely, including:

- ROTATION_SPEED
- MAP_WIDTH (uneven number)
- MAP_HEIGHT (uneven number)
- START_POSITION_X (uneven number)
- START_POSITION_Y (uneven number)
- LEVEL_TIMER
- SCORE_DISPLAY_TIMER
